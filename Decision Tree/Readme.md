**Decision Tree Classifier**

It is one of the supervised machine learning algorithms which has a set of logical rules on the features of instances in order to come to a conclusion. It is similar to a tree-like data structure. However, the features on which the rules have to be applied is determined by Entropy/Gini impurity/Misclassification Error metrics.

**Pros:**
1. Highly Interpretable
2. Few no.of parameters
3. Supports categorical & numerical features
4. Fast training & predicting

**Cons:**
1. Sensitive to noise in input data
2. Overfitting -> Every machine learning algorithm suffers from overfitting problem and this can be reduced using "pruning" for the decision trees
3. Can't support missing values
